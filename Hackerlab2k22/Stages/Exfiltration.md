# Description: 
```
A conversation between two terrorist groups has been intercepted. It is possible that very sensitive data was transmitted during the communication.

Flag : CTF_*

```

>For this challenge, we are given an PCAP file capture.pcap 
PCAP file contains a recorded conversation between a DNS client and a server, where DNS queries and CNAME responses seem to contain encoded messages:

>We can filter the cname queries with tshark 

`$ tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e dns.qry.name`

We wrote a python code to exfiltrate the data  

>We get two files. An image file and a zip file 
on the image file it is written rockyou ft leet. So we thought we have to crack the zip password with john using rockyou.txt but nothing ðŸ˜’. 
So we made a bruteforce 

`$ zip2john a.zip > hashes.txt`

`$ john hashes.txt` 

>After a few minutes we get the password of the file ðŸ˜Ž : **3c0w45**
We obtain our file flag.txt inside there is a code qr written with #. So we just have to scan the code to get the flag
